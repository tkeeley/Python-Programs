Mini-project #2 - "Guess the number"


 input will come from buttons and an input field
 all output for the game will be printed in the console
 
 There are a few things I used in this code although 
 we haven't covered it in this class yet.

    I know we haven't covered this yet but I know this from previous python courses I've taken
    It basically expects the possibility of a error being thrown and replaces the generic Error message 
    with that you create to let users know what happened
